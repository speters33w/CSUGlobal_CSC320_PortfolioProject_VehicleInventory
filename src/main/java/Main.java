 The following attributes should be present in your automobile class:

     private string make
     private string model

     private int year
     private int mileage

 Your program should have appropriate methods such as:

     default constructor
     parameterized constructor
     add a new vehicle  method
     list vehicle information (return string array)
     remove a vehicle method
     update vehicle attributes method

 All methods should include try...catch constructs.
 Except as noted all methods should return a success or failure message (failure message defined in "catch").
